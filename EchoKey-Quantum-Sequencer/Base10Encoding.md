# Quantum Sequencer: Base-10 Quantum Encoding

The quantum sequencer virtually encodes base-10 digits (0–9) by embedding them as amplitude-indexed quantum states within a Hilbert space of dimension ≥10, powered by a QuantumBase10Controller class. Here's how:

## 1. Quantum Encoding Mechanism

Each digit d ∈ {0,1,...,9} is mapped to a one-hot vector of length 2^n (where n is the number of qubits, and 2^n ≥ 10).

```python
state = np.zeros(2**num_qubits)
state[digit] = 1.0
qml.AmplitudeEmbedding(state, wires=range(num_qubits), normalize=True)
```

This prepares a quantum state where the probability amplitude is concentrated entirely on the index corresponding to the digit—functionally a one-hot amplitude encoding.

## 2. Cyclic Phase Rotation (EchoKey Integration)

To embed cyclicity, we rotate each qubit using a phase encoding based on the digit and its position in the fractal/cyclic structure:

```python
for n in range(self.num_qubits):
    angle = 2 * np.pi * digit / (2 ** n)
    qml.RZ(angle, wires=n)
```

This introduces digit-specific phase shifts that scale geometrically—contributing to recursive and cyclic fractal embeddings.

## 3. Entropy Injection via Keystream

EchoKey introduces controlled entropy using a seeded KeystreamScrambler, which perturbs the measured probability vector with high-entropy noise:

```python
entropy = self.scrambler.generate_keystream(len(probs)) / 255.0
adjusted_probs = probs * entropy
adjusted_probs /= np.sum(adjusted_probs)
```

This results in non-deterministic measurements that are refined over time by synergy and refraction logic.

## 4. Refraction via Synergy Parameters

The probabilities are further adjusted using EchoKey's synergy model—α (mean), β (std deviation), and γ (min) of recent states—which compute a refractive index:

```python
refractive_index = alpha + beta - gamma
adjusted_probs *= (1 + (layer * refractive_coefficient * refractive_index))
adjusted_probs /= np.sum(adjusted_probs)
```

This refractive correction adapts the probability distribution dynamically based on fractal layer depth and interaction synergy—reflecting emergent system memory.

## Summary

The quantum sequencer doesn't simply assign digits—it encodes, perturbs, and refracts them through a synergy-aware quantum-classical interface. Each digit is:

- Encoded in amplitude space (one-hot quantum state)
- Modulated with cyclic quantum phase gates
- Scrambled with entropy
- Corrected by synergy and refraction
- Predicted via machine learning (Random Forest and LSTM)

This creates a system that isn't just reactive—it adapts, remembers, and evolves with the dataset.
