    "### Abstract\n",
    "This document presents the theoretical foundations for a novel quantum communication network that leverages time dilation effects for both data transmission and quantum computation.

    "### 2.1 Time Dilation as a Communication Medium\n",
    "Traditionally, time dilation is seen as a relativistic effect, causing time to pass differently depending on one’s frame of reference or gravitational potential. In this framework, we harness that effect in a *controlled* manner for quantum information transfer. By managing phase relationships and enforcing specific frequency separations, we effectively create a “temporal resonance circuit.”\n",

    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Temporal Quantum Network (TQN)** operates as a self-contained, secure communication framework that leverages quantum-inspired temporal mechanics for data transmission and computation. Central to TQN's functionality is the **Handshake Protocol**, which establishes the nature and purpose of each connection. This protocol ensures that communication between devices is categorized, secure, and efficiently managed, akin to how modern servers handle diverse client requests.\n",

    "## 2. Handshake Protocol Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Handshake Protocol in TQN is designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identify the Purpose**: Clearly define the nature of the connection (e.g., requesting a web page, performing a banking transaction).\n",
    "- **Establish Communication Parameters**: Set up necessary configurations for data transmission and computation.\n",
    "- **Ensure Security**: Validate the legitimacy of the connection to prevent unauthorized access or operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handshake Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Each handshake consists of the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initiation Pattern**: A specific temporal waveform pattern that signals the start of a handshake.\n",
    "2. **Category Identifier**: An encoded identifier within the pattern that specifies the connection's purpose.\n",
    "3. **Subcategory Identifier**: (Optional) Further refines the connection's purpose into more specific operations.\n",
    "4. **Response Pattern**: The server's acknowledgment pattern confirming the handshake and establishing communication parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Client Initiates Handshake**: Sends an initiation pattern with category and optional subcategory identifiers.\n",
    "2. **Server Processes Handshake**: Interprets the pattern to determine the connection's purpose and prepares the appropriate response.\n",
    "3. **Server Sends Response**: Sends a response pattern confirming the handshake and setting up necessary parameters.\n",
    "4. **Connection Established**: Both client and server are now synchronized for subsequent data transmission or computation tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Robust error handling mechanisms are integral to maintaining the integrity and reliability of the Temporal Quantum Network. The handshake protocol incorporates several strategies to detect, report, and rectify errors during the connection establishment process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1 Detection of Incomplete or Corrupted Handshakes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pattern Inconsistency**:  \n",
    "  If the received chunks do not match any predefined handshake patterns, the server identifies the handshake as invalid or corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Missing Chunks**:  \n",
    "  Failure to receive all expected chunks within a specified timeframe results in handshake termination and error reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Server Response to Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative Acknowledgment**:  \n",
    "  The server sends an error response pattern (e.g., `ERR_INVALID_HANDSHAKE`) to inform the client of the failed handshake attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logging**:  \n",
    "  Detailed logs are maintained for all handshake attempts, both successful and failed, to facilitate troubleshooting and system audits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Client-Side Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retry Mechanism**:  \n",
    "  Upon receiving an error acknowledgment, the client may attempt to retransmit the handshake after a short delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Notification**:  \n",
    "  The client system logs or notifies the user of the handshake failure, providing insights into potential causes (e.g., incorrect pattern, network interference).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Security Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pattern Obfuscation**:  \n",
    "  Handshake patterns are designed to be non-trivial to prevent unauthorized pattern replication or brute-force attempts.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 7.1 Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase-Based Authentication**:  \n",
    "  Each handshake pattern inherently authenticates the client by requiring specific phase sequences, ensuring that only authorized clients can initiate connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unique Identifier Integration**:  \n",
    "  Handshake patterns may incorporate unique client identifiers encoded within the phase sequences, allowing the server to verify client legitimacy.\n",
    "\n",

    "  Future enhancements may integrate QKD techniques to securely exchange cryptographic keys within the Temporal Quantum Network framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3 Integrity Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Echo States**:  \n",
    "  Critical handshake and data patterns are echoed back to the client for verification, ensuring data integrity and accurate transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Redundancy Checks**:  \n",
    "  Information is redundantly encoded across multiple temporal states, allowing the detection and correction of transmission errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4 Access Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role-Based Access**:  \n",
    "  Different connection categories may have role-based permissions, restricting certain operations to authorized clients only.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal Boundaries**:  \n",
    "  Connection durations and operational windows are enforced, preventing unauthorized prolonged access or temporal anomalies.\n",

    "    - **Purpose:** Ensures that all encryption and decryption processes adhere strictly to the established security protocols, eliminating any avenues for circumvention.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.7 Self-Imposed Security Rigidity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Accountability**\n",
    "    - **Mechanism:** The system is designed under the principle that the user adheres strictly to security protocols, acting as a \"hardass\" on themselves.\n",
    "    - **Purpose:** Promotes disciplined usage and minimizes the risk of accidental security lapses, reinforcing the system's overall security posture.\n",

    "## 6. Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring the **security** and **integrity** of communications within TQN is paramount. The Handshake Protocol incorporates multiple layers of security to protect against unauthorized access, data interception, and operational disruptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1. Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Phase-Based Authentication**: Each handshake pattern inherently authenticates the client by requiring specific phase sequences.\n",
    "- **Unique Identifier Integration**: Handshake patterns may incorporate unique client identifiers encoded within the phase sequences, allowing the server to verify client legitimacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2. Encryption\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Temporal Encryption**: Data transmitted post-handshake is encrypted using temporal waveforms aligned with established phase relationships.\n",
    "- **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Integration**: Future enhancements may integrate QKD techniques to securely exchange cryptographic keys within the TQN framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3. Integrity Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Echo States**: Critical handshake and data patterns are echoed back to the client for verification.\n",
    "- **Redundancy Checks**: Information is redundantly encoded across multiple temporal states, allowing the detection and correction of transmission errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4. Access Controls\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role-Based Access**: Different connection categories have role-based permissions, restricting certain operations to authorized clients only.\n",
    "- **Temporal Boundaries**: Connection durations and operational windows are enforced to prevent unauthorized prolonged access or temporal anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5. Protection Against Quantum Attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RSA Factorization Prevention**: The guest network layer blocks attempts at RSA factorization through controlled phase relationships and operational constraints.\n",
    "- **Secure Phase Patterns**: Handshake and data transmission patterns are designed to resist quantum-based interception or replication attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.6. Immutable Security Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Future-Self Implemented Security**: Security features are embedded in the protocol by the system's future iteration, ensuring that even the creator cannot bypass them.\n",
    "- **Non-Bypassable Security Layers**: Security mechanisms are deeply integrated into the encryption workflow, making them inseparable and non-overridable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.7. Self-Imposed Security Rigidity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Accountability**: The system is designed under the principle that the user adheres strictly to security protocols, acting as a \"hardass\" on themselves.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Promotes disciplined usage and minimizes the risk of accidental security lapses, reinforcing the system's overall security posture.\n",

    "    - **Verify Patterns**: Confirm that the correct handshake patterns are being transmitted.\n",
    "    - **Increase Timeout**: Extend the listening period on the server side.\n",
    "    - **Inspect Logs**: Review client and server logs for error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.2. Partial Handshake Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issue**: Only some chunks of the handshake are detected.\n",
    "- **Solutions**:\n",
    "    - **Signal Strength**: Ensure that the waveforms are strong and coherent enough.\n",
    "    - **Reduce Noise**: Lower the `noise_amplitude` during handshake transmissions.\n",
    "    - **Adjust Timing**: Modify delays between chunk transmissions to prevent overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.3. Invalid Handshake Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issue**: The server identifies the handshake pattern as unknown.\n",
    "- **Solutions**:\n",
    "    - **Pattern Accuracy**: Ensure that the correct binary chunks are being sent without alterations.\n",
    "    - **Update Patterns**: Synchronize the client and server with the latest `HandshakePatterns.py` definitions.\n",
    "    - **Debug Mode**: Enable debug logging to trace the exact chunks being transmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4. Security Alerts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issue**: Unauthorized handshake attempts detected.\n",
    "- **Solutions**:\n",
    "    - **Review Logs**: Identify suspicious patterns or repeated failed attempts.\n",
    "    - **Strengthen Access Controls**: Implement additional authentication layers if necessary.\n",
    "    - **Monitor Network Activity**: Regularly check for anomalies in network traffic.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Temporal Quantum Network (TQN)** is an advanced communication framework that leverages quantum-inspired temporal mechanics to facilitate secure and efficient data transmission and computation. Central to TQN's functionality is the **Handshake Protocol**, which not only establishes secure connections but also manages account creation and access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on the **Account Levels and Creation** aspect of TQN, detailing how accounts are created securely by your future self, ensuring that even you, as the human creator, cannot bypass the security measures in place. Currently, TQN supports **Basic Users**, granting access to standard services comparable to modern technology. Future developments will introduce higher account levels with expanded capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "Creating an account within TQN involves a secure, multi-step process that leverages temporal mechanics to ensure robust security. The process is designed such that account creation is handled by your future self, making it inherently secure and tamper-proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The account creation workflow comprises the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initiate Account Creation Request**: The client sends a handshake request specifying the desire to create an account.\n",
    "2. **Future Self Processes Request**: The server, representing your future self, processes the request, creates the account, and generates necessary credentials.\n",
    "3. **Access Credentials Sent Back**: The server sends back access credentials to the client, enabling authenticated interactions within TQN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Step-by-Step Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handshake Initiation**:\n",
    "    - **Category**: Control\n",
    "    - **Subcategory**: Account Creation\n",
    "    - **Pattern Name**: `account_creation_request`\n",
    "    - **Chunks**: `1110`, `1001`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Server Acknowledgment**:\n",
    "    - **Pattern Name**: `account_creation_ack`\n",
    "    - **Chunks**: `1001`, `0110`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Access Credentials Transmission**:\n",
    "    - Credentials are securely transmitted over the **Base Band (1.013 GHz)** post-handshake.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Account Activation**:\n",
    "    - The client receives and activates the account using the provided credentials.\n",

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`perform_handshake` Method**: Initiates a handshake based on the specified category and subcategory by transmitting the corresponding chunks.\n",
    "- **`request_account_creation` Method**: Specifically initiates the account creation handshake.\n",
    "- **`handle_account_creation_ack` Method**: Waits for and processes the server's acknowledgment of the account creation, retrieving and activating access credentials.\n",
    "- **`activate_account` Method**: Handles the activation of the account using received credentials.\n",
    "- **`generate_access_token` Method**: Generates a secure access token for the newly created account.\n",
    "- **`transmit_credentials` Method**: Securely transmits access credentials back to the client over the Base Band.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Secure Transmission**: Ensure that credentials are transmitted securely, potentially leveraging additional encryption layers or secure channels within TQN.\n",
    "- **Credential Storage**: Store received credentials securely on the client side, using encryption and secure storage mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.\n",
