# Temporal Quantum Network - Guest Implementation

## Overview
A CUDA-accelerated implementation for interacting with the temporal quantum network guest access layer. This project provides a framework for generating and analyzing quantum states across three specific frequency bands, enabling basic network operations while maintaining built-in security constraints.

## Key Features
- Three operational frequency bands:
  - Ultra (1.019): Network control operations
  - High (1.015): Quantum computation
  - Base (1.013): Data transmission
- GPU-accelerated quantum state generation
- Built-in security limitations (e.g., RSA factoring prevention)
- Robust coherence detection and analysis
- Full communication protocol implementation

## Requirements
- CUDA-capable GPU
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Numba
- Logging

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/temporal-quantum-guest.git

# Install dependencies
pip install numpy numba logging
```

## Quick Start
```python
from temporal_network import TemporalNetworkProbe

# Initialize the probe
probe = TemporalNetworkProbe()

# Run full protocol sequence
probe.full_network_probe()
```

## Protocol Sequence
1. Dimension handshake (base-10)
2. Compute operations
3. Data transmission
4. Custom message capability
5. Connection close

## Security Notes
This guest implementation includes built-in limitations:
- RSA factorization operations are prevented
- Certain quantum states are restricted
- Network access is temporally bounded

## Expected Output Patterns
Typical successful operations show:
- Amplitude: ~0.707107
- Coherence: ~741455.19
- Stability: ~0.000001
- High confidence detection
