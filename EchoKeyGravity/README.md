# EchoKey-EFECGSC — EchoKey-Enhanced Field Equations for Graviton Clustering in Solar-Scale Gravity Cavities

A **research-only** notebook/code exploration of quantum→classical field transitions inside an idealized gravity “cavity.” It couples:

* a **TOV-style** stellar metric backbone,
* a **graviton-like** Schrödinger evolution with **fractal/recursive** potentials,
* **EchoKey** operators (cyclicity, synergy, adaptivity, outlier handling),
* and a **round-trip** demonstration (classicalization → de-classicalization).

**Unaudited. Not a physical claim or validated model.**

## EchoKey Asks — Compliance (Q/A)

1. **What is this repo, narrowly?**
   A self-contained prototype (notebook(s) and/or scripts) that numerically integrates an idealized TOV background and evolves a toy quantum state with EchoKey hooks to study coherence/fidelity during a quantum↔classical transition.

2. **What problem does it solve *here* (not in general)?**
   Gives a reproducible sandbox to test whether EchoKey operators can stabilize/steer a state toward a chosen classical metric and then return, while logging overlap/fidelity/entropy.

3. **What goes in / what comes out?**

* **Inputs (typical):** a stellar profile (radius, density, pressure) for TOV integration; small config for EchoKey operator weights and seeds.
* **Outputs (typical):** plots of metric and state evolution, CSV/NPZ logs of metrics (overlap, fidelity, entropy), and round-trip diagnostics printed in the run.

4. **One-minute demo (works for both notebooks or scripts):**

```bash
# (optional) venv
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
# deps
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or see Dependencies below
# open and run the notebook in this repo (preferred)
jupyter lab   # or: jupyter notebook
# ...then Run All Cells.

# If a script entry point exists in this repo, it's usually:
# python efecgsc_run.py --profile data/solar_profile.csv --steps 2000 --seed 1337
# (Check filenames/flags in the repo before running.)
```

5. **Threat model / validation status (plain language)?**

* This is **not** a tested GR/QG solver and makes simplifying assumptions.
* No empirical fit or observational validation is claimed.
* Results are **illustrative**, suitable for sandboxing ideas only.

6. **Determinism & seeds — can I reproduce exactly?**
   Yes—set the seed(s) in the config cell/flags and re-run with the same profile and parameters. EchoKey dynamics (synergy, fractal recursion, cyclicity) are deterministic under fixed seeds.

7. **EchoKey operator mapping (what’s actually used here)?**

| Operator                   | Where it lives conceptually         | Role here                                      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Cyclicity**              | periodic terms in coupling          | phase-locked nudges toward/away from coherence |
| **Fractality / Recursion** | nested potential builders           | multi-scale structure over the cavity          |
| **Synergy**                | cross-term matrix on windows/states | couples components for emergent stabilization  |
| **Adaptivity**             | parameter updates vs metrics        | strengthens/weakens coupling based on fidelity |
| **Outlier mgmt**           | clamps/penalties                    | keeps dynamics bounded/reversible on spikes    |

> These are **lightweight hooks** for experimentation—not a full EchoKey engine.

8. **Inputs format (repo-scoped expectations):**

* **Stellar profile CSV** with columns typically like: `r`, `rho`, `P` (radius, density, pressure).
  If your file differs, adjust the loader cell/args accordingly.
* **Config**: either a params cell in the notebook or CLI flags (if a script is provided).

9. **Outputs you should expect (repo-scoped):**

* Plots: metric components (e.g., $g_{00}, g_{11}$), state amplitude/phase/coherence, round-trip traces.
* Tables/CSV/NPZ: overlap, fidelity, entropy, step-wise EchoKey parameter values. Exact filenames are printed by the run.

10. **Non-goals (so reviewers don’t assume them):**

* No claim of real graviton detection or uniqueness.
* No rigorous QFT-in-curved-spacetime derivation.
* No observational fit to the Sun or any star.
* No numerical guarantees for stability beyond the clamps shown.

11. **License & how to cite:**

## Dependencies

Minimal set (use `requirements.txt` if present):

* `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`
* `numba` (optional speedups)
* `jupyterlab` or `notebook`
* `sympy` (optional, for symbolic checks)

Install quickly:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib numba jupyterlab sympy
```

## Typical Workflow

1. **Load profile** → integrate **TOV** to obtain metric components over radius.
2. **Initialize state** → graviton-like wavefunction in cavity bounds.
3. **Evolve forward** with EchoKey operators active (fractality/synergy/cyclicity/adaptivity).
4. **Measure metrics** each step: overlap with target classical field, fidelity, entropy.
5. **Reverse pass** to test round-trip.
6. **Log & plot** results.

## Troubleshooting (repo-scoped)

* **Exploding/NaN values** → lower step size; increase clamps; reduce fractal depth/synergy gain.
* **Non-reproducibility** → set and print seeds at start of run.
* **CSV mismatch** → rename columns or edit the loader cell to match your file.

## Contributing

Small, focused PRs that improve clarity, speed, or reproducibility are welcome. Keep changes strictly within this repo’s scope (EFECGSC toy model).
