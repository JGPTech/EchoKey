## What is this repository?

This repo collects notes, derivations, and minimal examples that frame EchoKey **as questions**.  
The goal is to formulate precise, checkable inquiries and to record the artifacts (definitions, lemmas, counterexamples, notebooks) that arise while investigating them.

**Non-goals:** production guarantees, performance claims, benchmark numbers, or application marketing.

## What EchoKey asks (v2)

EchoKey v2 treats equations as objects and introduces seven operator blocks intended for composition:

- **Cyclicity** `𝒞`: Does periodic structure extracted by `𝒞` commute with time differentiation on the classes we use?
- **Recursion** `ℛ`: Under which metrics does an iterated transform become a contraction with a unique fixed point?
- **Fractality** `𝓕`: What decay on multiscale weights ensures unconditional convergence in the chosen space?
- **Regression (Stability)** `𝒢`: When does a mean-reverting template generate a contraction family?
- **Synergy (Coupling)** `𝒮`: For a bounded bilinear form, what norms control pairwise and higher-order interactions?
- **Refraction (Layer/Domain)** `𝓝`: How does a layer transform alter regularity and spectrum across interfaces?
- **Outliers (Jumps/Measures)** `𝒪`: Which impulse conditions yield a well-posed measure-valued evolution?

**Composite question (v2):**  
For coordinates \( \mathbf{c}(t) \) of a state \( \Psi \) in a separable Hilbert space,
does the composite evolution
\[
\dot{\mathbf{c}}(t) = \big(\, \mathcal{C}\circ\mathcal{R}\circ\mathcal{F}\circ\mathcal{G}\circ\mathcal{S}\circ\mathcal{N}\circ\mathcal{O} \,\big)[\mathbf{c}(t)]
\]
admit local (or global) well-posedness under minimal, explicit hypotheses?
