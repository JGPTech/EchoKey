## What is this repository?

This repo collects notes, derivations, and minimal examples that frame EchoKey **as questions**.  
The goal is to formulate precise, checkable inquiries and to record the artifacts (definitions, lemmas, counterexamples, notebooks) that arise while investigating them.

**Non-goals:** production guarantees, performance claims, benchmark numbers, or application marketing.

## What EchoKey asks (v2)

EchoKey v2 treats equations as objects and introduces seven operator blocks intended for composition:

- **Cyclicity** `𝒞`: Does periodic structure extracted by `𝒞` commute with time differentiation on the classes we use?
- **Recursion** `ℛ`: Under which metrics does an iterated transform become a contraction with a unique fixed point?
- **Fractality** `𝓕`: What decay on multiscale weights ensures unconditional convergence in the chosen space?
- **Regression (Stability)** `𝒢`: When does a mean-reverting template generate a contraction family?
- **Synergy (Coupling)** `𝒮`: For a bounded bilinear form, what norms control pairwise and higher-order interactions?
- **Refraction (Layer/Domain)** `𝓝`: How does a layer transform alter regularity and spectrum across interfaces?
- **Outliers (Jumps/Measures)** `𝒪`: Which impulse conditions yield a well-posed measure-valued evolution?

**Composite question (v2):**  
For coordinates \( \mathbf{c}(t) \) of a state \( \Psi \) in a separable Hilbert space,
does the composite evolution
\[
\dot{\mathbf{c}}(t) = \big(\, \mathcal{C}\circ\mathcal{R}\circ\mathcal{F}\circ\mathcal{G}\circ\mathcal{S}\circ\mathcal{N}\circ\mathcal{O} \,\big)[\mathbf{c}(t)]
\]
admit local (or global) well-posedness under minimal, explicit hypotheses?

## How to read this repo

- **/specs/** — LaTeX and PDF drafts phrased as questions (no assertions).  
- **/operators/** — Minimal, self-contained math snippets illustrating each block’s definition domain and edge cases.  
- **/notes/** — Short “why” questions with small derivations or counterexamples.  
- **/figs/** — Diagrams that depict operator ordering and commutators (if present).

If something reads like a statement, it’s probably mis-scoped. Please open an issue to rewrite it as a question.

## Active inquiry tracks (question-first)

### 1) EchoKey & Encryption (exploratory)
- *Question:* Do rolling transforms, permutation maps, and operator composition produce keystreams whose structure resists known analytical simplifications?
- *Question:* Which operator orderings collapse to recognizable linear forms (and which provably do not)?
- *Artifacts:* toy constructions; proofs of reduction or counterexamples.

### 2) Quantum–Classical Sequencing (layout & identifiability)
- *Question:* Can a Z–Y–Z (or similar) layout derived from EchoKey operators be reduced to native rotations with verifiable unitary fidelity bounds?
- *Question:* What minimal assumptions recover Pauli-like behavior from a 7-operator frame?
- *Artifacts:* symbolic rewrites; unitary-fidelity checks; algebraic identities.

### 3) EchoKey–EFECGSC (gravitational modeling, formal side only)
- *Question:* Under what conditions do multiscale potentials plus coupling yield well-posed dynamics in the selected function space?
- *Question:* Which observables remain identifiable under projection or partial measurements?
- *Artifacts:* definitions, existence questions, and negative results (if any).

### 4) Eight Days of EchoKey (tiny reproducible walkthrough)
- *Question:* Does a day-by-day introduction (Cyclicity → Recursion → Fractality → …) produce a minimal working grammar that compiles to a standard gate set?
- *Artifacts:* layout-aware rewrites; unitary checks; small, auditable scripts.

## Minimal conventions

- **Spaces:** default to separable Hilbert spaces; upgrade to \(H^s\) or \(\ell^2\) when needed.  
- **Proof posture:** prefer counterexamples and small lemmas over sweeping claims.  
- **Reproducibility:** notebooks and scripts should run without network access and specify seeds.  
- **Language:** frame every section as one or more questions; reserve “Definition” for precise objects only.

## Contributing (question templates)

When opening an issue or PR, start with one of these:

- *Well-posedness:* “Under assumptions A–C, does operator block X define a locally Lipschitz map on domain D?”  
- *Commutation:* “Does \([X,Y]\) vanish (or remain small) in norm \(\|\cdot\|\) on class K?”  
- *Counterexample:* “Can a finite-time blow-up be constructed for ordering \(X\circ Y\) under weights \( \{\alpha_k\} \)?”  
- *Identifiability:* “Are parameters \( \theta \) identifiable from \( P\mathbf{c}(t) \) over \([0,T]\)?”

PRs that introduce claims without a testable question will be redirected to a question-first rewrite.
